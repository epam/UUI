## Install 

```
yarn add @epam/uui @epam/components @epam/loveship
```

## Getting started

We recommend to use our custom [UUI template](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@epam/cra-template-uui) for [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) to create React application with already configured environment.

## Development

To start locally

```
git clone git@github.com:epam/UUI.git
cd uui
yarn
yarn start
```

This would open the uui.epam.com web-site locally, in watch mode.
