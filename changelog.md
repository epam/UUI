# 5.1.0 - 29.06.2023

**What's New**

**Rich Text Editor component update and improvements**

UUI `SlateEditor` was reworked and updated to the actual version of Slate.js framework.
During the update the previous code based of RTE almost completely rewritten due to a lot of breaking changes from Slate.js side. However, we put significant efforts to minimize breaking changes for our users. Therefore, update to the new version of `uui-editor` package should be seamless and easy.

List of changes:
* [Breaking change]: Changed RTE value format, now it's works with array instead of immutable.js object. Also, there are some additional changes inside slate value structure.
We make an automatic migration from old state format to the new one, so it's not required any additional actions from your side. But if you make some manipulations with value object on your side, it will cause issues, contact us if you faced with such case.
* Regarding the new value format it's not needed to convert value to JSON via `value.toJSON()` and `Value.fromJSON(value)` in your code.

* Added possibility to add caption for images
* Added possibility to insert new line after image/video/iframe
* Added images adjusting when width of RTE container is changing
* Added support of different spell checking extensions, like Grammarly
* Now visited links doesn't highlight with visited style in edit mode
* Long links now fit table cell width
* Improved content copying from Microsoft Word files
* Added autofocus on input in 'Add Link' modal
* A lot of issues and improvements from Slate.js version update
* Fixed page crash after delete horizontal line/separator
* Fixed adding list inside table
* Fixed text selection breaks if mouse cursor lands on toolbar
* Fixed reverse text in list in Safari
* Fixed color bar closing by color click
* Fixed sticky toolbar disappears after selecting any options in it in Safari
* Fixed link replacement without first deleting it
* Fixed error after setting list on empty line
* Fixed error after inserting a list previously cut from the editor


**What's Fixed**
* [PickerInput]: disabled 'Clear' button in footer in case when `disableClear` prop is `true`
* [TimePickerBody]: fixed the bug where `minutes` values that are not a multiple of  `minutesStep`, are not rounded up to a `step`
* [TextInput]: fixed incorrectly text color in disabled state in Safari
* [useTableState]: fixed checked state overriding to the initial value


# 5.0.1 - 13.06.2023

    * added 42 and 48 sizes

* [FiltersPanel]: fixed styles for body & toggler according to design
* [Pickers]:
  - rewritten `Pickers` to functional components;
  - moved from `getView`to `useView` hook;

* [DataSources][useView]:
  - [BreakingChange]: `useView` is not recreating view on `onValueChange` update anymore;
  - [BreakingChange]: added `deps` to `useView` as a last argument; changing the `deps` causes recreating of a `view`.

# 5.0.0 - 06.06.2023

**Themes**

This release introduces Themes support. `@epam/uui` package now contains components, which can be styled differently according to an applied Theme - a set of global CSS variables.

`@epam/promo` and `@epam/loveship` packages are re-built on top of `@epam/uui` package. This allows us to unify codebase, and reduce differences between 'loveship' and 'promo'. We also aligned APIs, functionality and visual appearance between 'promo' and 'loveship' skins, as a result, we removed or deprecated some props or their values.

Pay attention that this release requires some additional actions for the library to work properly.
You can find migration guide and full list of changes [here](https://github.com/epam/UUI/wiki/Migration-guide-to-UUI-v.5).

Note: Currently, we use Themes internally to implement Loveship and Promo. In future, we allow UUI users to build their own themes, and using Themes variables for customization. However, in this release we haven’t yet finalized Themes APIs (CSS variables names). We can’t yet recommend using Themes internals, e.g. override Themes CSS variables for customization.

**Testing facilities and documentation**
* Introduced new `@epam/uui-test-utils` package. It provides a set of helpers, utils and mocks which facilitate creation of unit tests for UUI components.
* Was added Testing [documentation](https://uui.epam.com/documents?id=testing-basics&category=testing). It contains general guidelines, best practices and tools which we are recommending to use for UUI components testing.
Also, it contains a Cookbook describing typical use cases with code examples as well as frequent questions & answers.

**DataSources documentation**
* Introduced the new [DataSources documentation](https://uui.epam.com/documents?id=dataSources-getting-started&category=dataSources), that covers a wide range of topics related to the DataSources, accompanied by illustrative examples.
  Note that this is the first revision of this doc, so we would appreciate your feedback and have plans to continuously improve this documentation.

**ESM modules support**
* EcmaScript modules (ESM) are now included into UUI packages. Usage of ESM should help to eliminate unused code via tree shaking. CommonJs modules will be published along with ESM in the same package for backwards compatibility.

**Other changes**
* We made UUI compatible with Vite build toolchain. You can find template project of UUI + Vite [here](https://github.com/epam/UUI/tree/develop/templates/uui-vite-template).
* The `@epam/assets` package and "assets" folders inside promo and loveship packages were cleaned up: some "*.scss" files were deleted. Please copy any missing files directly to your project if they are still needed.
* [useTableState]:
  - [BreakingChange]: removed `initialFilter` prop, if you need to provide any initial state for hook, pre-generate an url link with this state on you side.
  - added storing of sorting, columns config, and paging state into url
  - now hook accepts optional `IEditable` props, use them for cases when you need to store DataTableState by yourself. If passed it assumed that you will handle all state changes on your side and hook will not store any state into url.
* [ContextProvider]: removed support of legacy React context API, as it were announced in 4.1.0 version. `enableLegacyContext` prop was deleted.
* [ApiContext]: removed the code which handles `/auth/login` for the apps, which doesn't handle this themselves.
  If an app doesn't handle `/auth/login correctly`, this needs to be implemented implicitly. There are several options:
  - Handle /auth/login path server-side. Server should log in user (via redirects to SSO), and - after success, return the following HTML:
    `<script>window.opener && window.opener.postMessage("authSuccess", "*")</script>`
  - Handle /auth/login path client-side. The simplest method is to add the following to the index.js:
    `window.opener && window.location.pathname === '/auth/login' && window.opener.postMessage("authSuccess", "*");`
  - If an app implements UUI-based login pages, they need to run the following code after successful login:
    `window.opener && window.opener.postMessage("authSuccess", "*")`
* [DataTable]: deprecated column `shrink` property was removed, as it was announced in 4.9.0 version.
* [MainMenuDropdown]: added callback `renderBody` prop.
* [FiltersPanel]:
    - hide 'Add filter' button, if all filters `isAlwaysVisible`
    - added `presets` prop to rangeDatePicker filter
    - added `filter` prop for datePicker and rangeDatePicker filters
* [PickerInput]:
  - added `implicit` cascade selection mode. In this mode selecting a parent node means that all children are considered checked,
but only the checked parent is present in the Picker's value or DataSourceState.checked array.
  - now items which present in selection and doesn't exist in DataSource will be shown in picker as '[Unknown]'

# 4.9.0-rc.1 - 24.10.2022

**What's New**

This release prepares UUI for full-featured editable tables support. Editable tables were possible before this - via hooking into renderRow, building a separate component for row, and certain tricks to re-render it w/o re-rendering whole table. However, this was a complex and feature-limited approach.

In this release, we add first-class support for editable cells, and adjust our infrastructure to support various other features to make DataTables editable. You can find example and documentation how to create editable table [here](https://uui.epam.com/documents?id=editableTables&mode=doc&skin=UUI4_promo&category=tables).

With this release you already can build editable tables. However, we are planning to improve certain parts in the future releases, e.g. simplify adding/removing/moving rows in tables.

* [Breaking Change]: DataSources and DataTables-related interfaces refactored:
  * DataTableRowProps type is moved from @epam/uui-components to @epam/uui-core
  * columns prop is moved from DataRowProps to DataTableRowProps interface
    * if you have your own DataTable implementation, you'd need to replace renderRow callback type to use the DataTableRowProps interface instead of DataRowProps
  * DataTableCell interface extended to support editable cells (backward compatible)

* ArrayDataSource - ```items``` prop value can now be updated dynamically.
  Prior to this fix, the only way to update ```items```, is to add them as `useArrayDataSource` dependencies. This forces DataSource to re-create everything, forcing re-render of all tables' rows. This was slow, especially if you need to make cells editable - i.e. re-render on each keystroke. Now, you can safely remove your items from deps: useArrayDataSource(..., ~~[items]~~), which will improve performance.
* DataSources: ```getRowOptions``` is called on each update, allowing to dynamically change rows behavior. For example, you can dynamically enable/disable checkboxes in Tables or PickerInputs.
* DataSources: getRowOptions - DataRowOptions now implements `IEditable<TItem>` interface. This allows to make rows editable, by passing value/onValueChange directly, or by using lens.toProps(): `getRowOptions(item) => lens.prop(item.id).toProps()`

* [Breaking Change]: DataTableCell layout reworked.
  * Cells and tables tweaked to support vertical borders, hover/focus border effects for editable cells
  * Now, cell content is rendered in flexbox context (was block). Please review cells layout (alignment and width of the cells content)
  * DataTableColumn - new prop: justifyContent, which sets appropriate flexbox property. Can be used to align items horizontally. If omitted, we use existing textAlign property to set it. I.e. you can still use textAlign: left/center/right to align textual cell content.
  * DataTableCell renders focus/hover effects (borders) on their own. We removed these effects from all inputs with mode='cell'.

* [Breaking Change]: DataTable columns widths props are simplified. Columns width are defined by width (in pixels), and (optionally) grow - which defines a part of empty space for column to occupy. Props affected:
  * shrink prop - marked @deprecated. It will be removed in future versions.
    'shrink' prop wasn't supported even before this change, so you can safely remove it from all columns.
    Column can't 'shrink' (become less than width), as we add horizontal scrolling instead of shrinking in case all columns doesn't fit.
  * 'width' prop is now required (was optional).
    If you didn't have 'width' on a column, most probably you mean width=0 and have grow=1 - to make the column to occupy all empty space. You can set width: 0 explicitly in such cases.
  * 'minWidth' prop now doesn't work as flex-item prop, it only serves as minimum width for manual column resizing. Default is minWidth = width.

* [Breaking Change]: DataSources doesn't work with array/object ids by-default. In certain cases, we used IDs like [123, 'group-row'] to handle scenarios when there are different types of entities, with overlapping ids. E.g. item groups, and actual records in grouping table case. They are no-longer supported by default.
  * If you use such ids, set `complexIds = true` prop when creating DataSource. In this case, DataSource will use JSON.stringify to use IDs as Map keys internally. This was default behavior prior this change, which has impact on performance, so it's made optional
  * number and string ids are supported correctly by default

* useForm now provides two new callbacks: setValue and replaceValue.
    They work the same way as setState of React.useState.
    Besides a plain new form value, both can accept a function `(currentValue: T) => T`. This option is useful if you want to use `useCallback` to memoize operations on the whole state of the form.
    setValue acts as a usual user-made change to a form - sets isChanged, creates undo checkpoint, etc.
    replaceValue doesn't update isChanged, and can be used for technical needs. E.g. to store values like 'currentTab' in the form state.

* Metadata<T> type - 'all' prop now infer the type of array element or object values (was typed as 'any')

* Lenses now memoizes all methods calls (.prop, .item, etc.).
    This allows to not re-create onValueChange callbacks on re-renders.
    In turn, it opens a way to use React.memo/shouldComponentUpdate optimization for IEditable components.

* [PresetsPanel]: Added new `PresetsPanel` component, which allows you to save your current filtration into presets and manage them. See demo [here](https://uui.epam.com/demo?id=filteredTable).

* [AdaptivePanel]: Added new `AdaptivePanel` component. This component helps you to layout elements inside container and hide items by their priorities if they didn't fit.
* [MainMenu]: reworked based on `AdaptivePanel`, now you can provide menu elements in new format via `items` prop. But we also left working old approach with children, so no action is required from your side.

* [Numeric Input] - reworked to display number is locale format (e.g. with decimal and thousands separators) while not being edited.
  * Formatting can be disabled with the `disableLocaleFormatting` prop
  * min/max are no longer required. By default, NumericInput only accepts positive whole numbers.
  * A lot of display options are now possible via NumberFormatOptions: currencies, units, flexible min/max fractional digits limits, etc.
  * See more at the [docs page](https://uui.epam.com/documents?id=numericInput&mode=doc&skin=UUI4_promo&category=components)

# 4.8.3 - 01.09.2022

**What’s Fixed**
* [PickerInput]: disabled elements in multi-picker no longer can be deleted with cross at tag in the input. Before this fix, cross icon was visible, and clicking it caused crash
* [LazyDataSource]: Select All now selects only currently visible items. Prior the fix, all items which was loaded before (e.g. with other/no filters) was selected.
* [useVirtual]: Improved visible range computation:

  Virtual lists now adjust visible area in fixed-sized 'blocks'. E.g. topIndex, visibleCount, and from/count in LazyDataSource requests will be always divisible by Block Size. This helps to avoid cases when only several rows are requested on small scrolls. This also can help with pageNo/pageSize-oriented API. Block size defaults to 20, and configurable with `blockSize` prop.

  We also render more rows above and below visible area to avoid blank areas and loading rows when scrolling at normal speed. This is also configurable with `overdrawRows` setting (defaults to 20, meaning at least 20 rows above/below the visible area are rendered)

  This change also fixes the problem when lazy-loading stops, while the end of the list is not reached.

# 4.1.0 - 30.06.2021

**What’s New**
* [DataSources][Breaking Change]: Added required 'deps' argument for all DataSources hooks. Please review all your dataSources hooks usage and decide which deps do you need or set '[]'.
* [React Context]: added support for new React Context API. Consider switching to new context APIs in your components (or keep using the global ctx variable pattern). In class components you can use "static contextType = UuiContext", in function components you can use the hook "useUuiContext". Legacy context API still works in parallel with the new API. We'll keep support for legacy context API for at least 3 month (can be extended if projects would ask to prolong the support). You can explicitly disable legacy contexts with enableLegacyContexts={ false } prop on the ContextProvider. It is recommended if you don't use legacy contexts

* [LazyDataSource]: exactRowsCount is now returned when known

# 4.0.0 - 07.05.2021

**What’s New**
* [LazyDataSource] now supports nesting (grouping, trees) with lazy loading.

  Quick start:
    - pass the ```getChildCount(item): number``` prop. It should return an either:

        - exact number of item's children (a server can return this as an parent's field)
        - a guessed/average number of children (e.g. 1) (this can result more API calls if items are unfolded by default)

    - update the 'api' callback to accept a second argument. When children are needed, we'll pass a parent entity in this new argument.
      Change your callback to perform request to server to retrieve children.

        - if you have different server APIs for parent and children, just tweak your 'api' callback like this:
            ```
            api: (rq, ctx) => {
                if (!ctx.parent)
                    return callParentApi(rq);
                else
                    return callChildrenApi(rq);
            }
            ```

        - if you want to retrieve children as parent's field, you can return them in api callback directly from parent's field, like: ```Promise.resolve({ items: ctx.parent.chidren, count: ctx.parent.children.length })```

    * [Breaking Change] Item lists caching is moved from LazyDataSource to LazyTreeView.
      Items by ID cache is still in the LazyDataSource.
      We also stoped caching any previous loads of lists.
      This means that:
        - there can be a bit more load on server
        - there can be issues, if you rely on LazyDataSource internal cache somehow

    * [Breaking Change] LazyDataSource's 'cacheSize' prop is removed.
      There's no more lists cache in the LazyDataSource (except the items by id cache)

    * [Breaking Change] DataSources and DataSourceView internal APIs changed.
      BaseDataSourceProps, [Lazy|Array]DataSourceParams, [Lazy|Array]DataSourceOptions, [Lazy|Array]ViewParams, [Lazy|Array]ViewOptions interfaces are merged into [Lazy|Array]DataSourceProps and [Lazy|Array]ViewProps.
      Applications which implements it's own DataSources, or leverage on these interfaces somehow, might need to update.

    * [Breaking Change] LazyDataSource always query from the start.
      Before, it was able to query the middle of the list, without querying start items.
      This can't be supported for 2-nd level of lists, and we don't see much use of this feature.
      Contact us if you really need this behavior.

    * [Breaking Change] LazyDataSource's generic parameters order changed from TItem, TFilter, TId, to a common TItem, TId, TFilter.

* DataRowProps - extended with 'isLastChild' and 'path' props.
  isLastChild is true, if this row is the last of it's parent's children.
  Path prop contains all row's parents' ids and isLastChild prop.

  These props are required to implement tree components, which renders lines connecting children with parents.

  Both Lazy and ArrayDataSources supports these new props.

* [Forms] Forms validation - better cross-fields dependencies.
  'validate' function in Metadata now receives all parent objects in path as argument.
  Each validator receives N arguments - first is the value itself, then it's container, and down to the root object.
  You can use this to make validation dependencies between items. For example:
  ```
    const value = { array: [{ id: 100, name: 'abc' }, { id: 101, name: 'bcd' }] };
    const nameValidator = (name, item, array) => [item.id > 100 && name.length < 2 && "Items with ID > 100 should have names longer than 2"];
    const meta = { array: { all: { props: { name: { validators: [nameValidator] }}}}};
  ```

* [Form]: Added server validation mechanism. If you need to get form validation state from server-side, your onSave api should return object like `{ validation?: ICanBeInvalid }`

* [Tables]: Added columns resizing and reordering possibility:
    * Added 'allowColumnsReordering' and 'allowColumnsResizing' props to the DataTable and DataTableHeaderRow.
    * Columns config was moved to the DataTable value.
    * [Breaking Change]: Removed 'settingKey' prop form DataTable, if you are using it for storing your columns in localStorage — implement it manually on your side via ```svc.uuiUserSettings``` context.

* [Tooltip] & [Dropdown]: Popper.js updated to v.2.x, added 'hide' modifier to hide body when target scrolled outside view
    * [Breaking Change]: In Popper 2 modifiers is now an array of objects, instead of an object where each property was the modifier name in the previous version. [More information.](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/migration-guide/)

# 3.46.3 - 12.01.2021

**What’s New**
* [Breaking Change] UUI and edu-core-rouing packages doesn't depend on react-router and history directly anymore.
    As yarn/npm uses both your App's and UUI required versions, the version of history and react-router in your app can be changed after updating.
    This can affect your app. You can check version with ```yarn why history``` and ```yarn why react-router``` before and after update.

    This change is required to not interfere with app's versions of the router and history.
    ContextProvider still requires history object to be passed. It should have a 'IHistory4' interface - a minimal subset of the History v4 API.

    edu-core-rouing package is kept to support history and router v3 (Learn still uses them)

    Internally, we use a wrapper/proxy implementations for IRouterContext, that adapts interfaces of different history versions to our interface.
    In future, this allows us to support different routing libraries, by providing a different IRouterContext implementation.

* [Breaking Change]: Updated colors palette to matсh design specification.
   - Color names stayed the same, only hex changed;
   - New colors variables moved to @epam/loveship from @epam/assets. Old variables stayed in @epam/assets.
     So, if you use our variables in your project, and now don't ready to do this migration, just leave import from @epam/aseets in your styles.
     If you want to use new colors, please import styles from '@epam/loveship/assets/styles';
   - Pay additional attention on components where you pass color by props, for example `<Text color='night400'>`, especially for gray scale colors(probably you will not face a problems with not gray scale colors).
     Because, almost all 'night' colors changed their tone and sometimes you will need to use another color instead you have before.
     If you have questions, which color to use - please contact your project designer or use this guide:

# 3.40.1

* [Breaking Changes]:

* Added locaclization for all packages. Each package have i18n.ts file, with all end-user UI strings, you can export it into your project and redifine strings for your locale;
* Removed JQuery from packages dependecy;
* [Slate]: Fixed bug with incorrect cursor behavior in Firefox;
* [PickerInput]: Added autofocus prop;
* [PickerInput]: Fixed bug with selecting item with id === 0;


# 3.40.0

* New **PROMO** skin components
* **DataSources rework**:
  - DataSources are now plain classes, not React components. DataSources no longer handles DataRows generation, events, and UI updates - they are just boxes with some cached / pre-computed data.
    This simplifies a lot:
      - you can create and store instances where convenient. For example, it's ok to create global instances of certain data sources, which wouldn't update often - like locations for pickers.
      - this leads to simpler APIs. For example, in Pickers instead of tricky `getDataSource = { props => <ArrayDataSource {...props } /> }` API, you just pass your DataSource: `dataSource = {{ myDataSource }} `

  - Introduced a new concept - View. Having a DataSource, component can create a View with `dataSource.getView`. Views are created per-component, allowing multiple components to share the same DataSource. They handle all component-depended logic - DataRows generation, according to search/filter/folding/selection in DataSourceState, UI updates, event handling. If you use existing components, you usually don't need to deal with Views directly, as they are created internally by components themselves. However, if you want to build your components, or just access data inside DataSources directly, they can be useful. See more in examples.

  - A set of react hooks now available: useLazyDataSource, useArrayDataSource, useAsyncDataSource, and IDataSource.useView. They create appropriate DataSources and manages subscription/unsubscription/refresh for you. While DataSources can still be used directly, please prefer hooks for Functional Components.

  - Breaking changes:

    - DataSources should be created outside the picker. With either `myDataSource = new ArrayDataSource()`, or with new useArrayDataSource() hook.

    - DataSources are passed to components with `dataSource = {{ myDataSource }} ` instead of `getDataSource = { props => <ArrayDataSource {...props } /> }`

    - some options, like getRowOptions, getSearchFields, cascadeSelection, isFoldedByDefault are moved to Views. In case of Pickers, you can pass them directly to Picker props, instead of DataSource props.

    - SortBy callback removed from columns config. By default, sorting applies by the column 'key' field.
    If you need another behavior, pass sortBy callback to the View.

    - filters removed from ArrayDataSource. Instead, you can use `getFilter` option on ArrayListView.

# 3.20.0

* 'mode' prop for most inputs. It has three values:
  * 'form' - the default one, controls appears as usual
  * 'inline' - control appears w/o borders, as plain text. Border appears on hover. Can be used for WYSIWIG-style editing.
  * 'cell' - controls appears w/o borders, hover/focus add squared border. This is intended to be used as in-cell editors in editable tables.
* Control sizes rework (backward-compatible):
  * Text and most input components, got optional lineHeight and fontSize props. Default values are chosen according to the size prop, and match prior settings. You can use these props to tweak font appearance.
    * Obviously useful for Text, but also for inline inputs; and editable cells (design guidelines put less line-height than default there)
    * The formula is: padding top/bottom = (size - line-height) / 2. This means that a control get height exactly equal to 'size' if you get one-line text, and it will be center-aligned properly.
    * Some font-sizes wouldn't fit some line-heights. Keep this in mind, and choose reasonable combinations of line-height and font-size. Design guidelines on possible combinations will be ready soon.
    * Extreme line-height and size combinations are not supported (like size=60, line-height=12). Let us know if you need that.
  * Added 42 size for most components.
  * 48 size will be deprecated, as it's not approved by design team. Let us know if you use it. The plan is to deprecate it.
* File upload facilities added:
  * A new DropSpot component, which can wrap areas where files can be dropped. It handles all machinery of file DnD events handing.
  * ApiContext.uploadFile() method added. It use XHRRequest instead of fetch, and allow tracking progress. No error handling for now, it will be added later.
  * We are still lacking docs and demos for file upload features, contact core team for help
* [Breaking changes] Removed vPadding prop from DataTable.
  * Added renderCell callback for table column props. Can be used to replace whole cell, including padding
  * Rework padding prop for DataTableCell component, now there are rowPadding(value for first and last column) and padding (value for all columns) props.
  * For 36-sized tables, switch to size=36, and use new line-height props for texts and inputs to fit cell properly.
* uui-build now supports SAAS/SCSS. We are going to gradually migrate whole library to scss
  * @epam/assets/scss - more mixins and variables migrated from less
* new uui-editor package: a Slate.js-based Rich Text Editor, with pre-configured plugins.
  * Still work in progress, we aim for production quality at the end of July
* Reworked page layout on UUI sandbox app. New page layout puts scrollbars on body, improving mobile experience. It also allows to disable menus on particular pages, and fall-back to the old layout style if necessary.

  * removed excess TS compilation pass
  * build performance improved

# 3.19.2 - broken release

* uui-build: BUILD_DIR settings

# 3.19.1

* Introduced internationalization: ability to translate component's text. Currently hard-coded texts are moved to a i18n.ts file, and can be overrided if needed. For now, only RichTextEditor-related dialogs are reworked this way. We'll refine the approach, and will allow such customization for other components when needed.
* Form components: fixes in unsaved data-related logic

# 3.19.0

* @epam/uui/Stateful Component now supports storing state in query string
* urlParser.ts - arrays, boolean, and numbers are serialized now in query string
* UUI IRouterContext - added getCurrentLink method

# 3.18.1

* SliderRating - fixed ToolTip hover zone
* TextInput.focus() method added. Can be used via component ref.
* withMods helper now passes by wrapped component's ref with React.forwardRef
* Dropdown - fixed performance issue caused by broken events' un-subscription, and over-use of getBoundingClientRect.
* DataTableRow - enabled horizontal scrolling using middle mouse button and touchpad gestures
* Unsaved form state handling. Pass "settingsKey" prop to Form, to make form store edited values in the UserSettings context (local store by default). If Form component detect non-saved changes, it will ask user if it wants to restore these changes. Use that to provide additional barrier to not to lose user-entered data.
* The whole new icons set build by Design Platform team is pre-processed and published to @epam/assets/icons/common. Pre-processing includes file name normalization, fixing issues with symbol IDs, removing 'fill' style to be able to color icons, and other tweaks and optimizations.
  * Note: new icons are not yet compatible with UUI3 components. There are size mismatch, and we are in progress updating all buttons and input to the new size. However, we published icons early, as there can be other uses.
* Two new loaders icons in the set. Usable in any button or input.
* fixed layout problem RadioInput, Checkbox, and Dropdown menu in latest Chrome (broken SVG sizing)

# 3.18.0

* [Breaking change] DatePicker and RangeDatePicker date format handling changed:
  * value and onValueChange are now always use date in YYYY-MM-DD format, despite component's "format" prop value
  * the "format" prop now affects display format only, not internal 'value' format
  * this behaviour matches <input type='date' > behavior: it can change display format according to user's locale, but always use YYYY-MM-DD format in API. Your can swap <DatePicker> with <TextInput type='date'> on mobile devices to get better UX.
  * default value for the "format" prop is set to more readable "MMM D, YYYY", e.g. "20 May, 2019"
  * invalid dates are no longer passed to onValueChanged callback, i.e. while user types dates. onValueChange is only fired when complete and correct date is entered

# 3.7.0

* [Breaking Change] - CSS styles are extracted.
    Users need to import them explicitly.

    Before this change, we kept all CSS code inside JS, and they are injected into DOM on app start.
    However, it can hit performance, adds mess in HEAD, and it's was tricky to override UUI styles, as they get placed on top of app's styles.
    With new version, we extract all CSS into separate 'styles.css' files.
    To import styles, please add following to your index.tsx/jsx file:
    ```tsx
        import '@epam/uui-components/styles.css';
        import '@epam/loveship/styles.css';
    ```
    Consider placing these imports before any your App's import, as it would place UUI styles before yours, making it's easier to override if needed.

* [Breaking Change] Modals rendering moved from ContextProvider to the separate @epam/uui-components/Modals component. This is done to make certain contexts (like Apollo) visible inside modal components.
To update, please add make this changes:
    ```tsx
        <>
            ...
            <ErrorHandler>
                {this.props.children}
            </ErrorHandler>
