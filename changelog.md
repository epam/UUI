# 4.2.0 - 23.08.2021

**What's New**
* Improved accessibility and keyboard support for a lot of components
* Replace Moment by Dayjs
* Added mobile view for Pickers
* [AnalyticsContext] [Breaking Change]: Removed amplitude client from UUI and implemented IAnalyticsListener to pass any analytics client from client side. If you use Amplitude into your project, now you need to create IAnalyticsListener and add it to the Analytic Context. See the example [here](https://uui.epam.com/documents?category=contexts&id=analyticsContext);
* [DropdownMenu] Implement DropdownMenu component in UUI4[Promo].

  DropdownMenu allows you to create vertical menus with a nested structure that pops up on hover or click (default is on hover).
  The main possibilities:

        - render menu item with an icon in the left or right position ('left' as default).
        - highlight menu item as selected passing 'isSelected' prop.
        - render you own custom component as DropdownMenu item.
        - to splite items as a group.
* [AvatarStack]: add possibility render custom avatar by the prop renderItem
* [FlexRow]: add more sizes for vPadding prop


**What’s Fixed**
* [Badge]: fix cursor pointer if badge is clickable.
* [PickerInput]: fix paddings for the PickerItem, so that if the value is too long the item looks with indented.
* [MainMenuSearch]: fix passing 'onAccept' prop from MainMenuSearch to TextInput
* [VirtualList]: replace legacy react-custom-scrollbars by react-custom-scrollbars-2
* [PickerInput]: fix pass the mode prop to PickerToggler so that apply correct style according to the mode
* [Button]: fix the text color for the button so that the text and border color are the same color
* [TextArea]: fix scrolling jump after typing when received autosize prop
* [VirtualList]: fix the width for container

[Typography]: fix global margin and padding for tags and elements
[PickerInput]: fix paddings for the PickerItem, so that if the value is too long the item looks with indented.

# 4.1.0 - 30.06.2021

**What’s New**
* [DataSources][Breaking Change]: Added required 'deps' argument for all DataSources hooks. Please review all your datasources hooks usage and decide which deps do you need or set '[]'.
* [React Context]: added support for new React Context API. Consider switching to new context APIs in your components (or keep using the global ctx variable pattern). In class components you can use "static contextType = UuiContext", in function components you can use the hook "useUuiContext". Legacy context API still works in parallel with the new API. We'll keep support for legacy context API for at least 3 month (can be extended if projects would ask to prolong the support). You can explicitly disable legacy contexts with enableLegacyContexts={ false } prop on the ContextProvider. It is recommended if you don't use legacy contexts
* removed legacy lifecycle methods
* [NumericInput]: Now NumericInput supports transfer of formatter function. The function responds to the onBlur action.
* [PickerInput]: pass onFocus and onBlur in props

**What’s Fixed**

* [VirtualList]: Fixed issue with dynamic items heights
* [PickerList]: fixed sorting direction
* [LazyDataSource]: exactRowsCount is now returned when known

# 4.0.0 - 07.05.2021

**What’s New**
* [LazyDataSource] now supports nesting (grouping, trees) with lazy loading.

  Quick start:
    - pass the ```getChildCount(item): number``` prop. It should return an either:

        - exact number of item's children (a server can return this as an parent's field)
        - a guessed/average number of children (e.g. 1) (this can result more API calls if items are unfolded by default)

    - update the 'api' callback to accept a second argument. When children are needed, we'll pass a parent entity in this new argument.
      Change your callback to perform request to server to retrieve children.

        - if you have different server APIs for parent and children, just tweak your 'api' callback like this:
            ```
            api: (rq, ctx) => {
                if (!ctx.parent)
                    return callParentApi(rq);
                else
                    return callChildrenApi(rq);
            }
            ```

        - if you want to retrieve children as parent's field, you can return them in api callback directly from parent's field, like: ```Promise.resolve({ items: ctx.parent.chidren, count: ctx.parent.children.length })```

    * [Breaking Change] Item lists caching is moved from LazyDataSource to LazyTreeView.
      Items by ID cache is still in the LazyDataSource.
      We also stoped caching any previous loads of lists.
      This means that:
        - there can be a bit more load on server
        - there can be issues, if you rely on LazyDataSource internal cache somehow

    * [Breaking Change] LazyDataSource's 'cacheSize' prop is removed.
      There's no more lists cache in the LazyDataSource (except the items by id cache)

    * [Breaking Change] DataSources and DataSourceView internal APIs changed.
      BaseDataSourceProps, [Lazy|Array]DataSourceParams, [Lazy|Array]DataSourceOptions, [Lazy|Array]ViewParams, [Lazy|Array]ViewOptions interfaces are merged into [Lazy|Array]DataSourceProps and [Lazy|Array]ViewProps.
      Applications which implements it's own DataSources, or leverage on these interfaces somehow, might need to update.

    * [Breaking Change] LazyDataSource always query from the start.
      Before, it was able to query the middle of the list, without querying start items.
      This can't be supported for 2-nd level of lists, and we don't see much use of this feature.
      Contact us if you really need this behavior.

    * [Breaking Change] LazyDataSource's generic parameters order changed from TItem, TFilter, TId, to a common TItem, TId, TFilter.

* DataRowProps - extended with 'isLastChild' and 'path' props.
  isLastChild is true, if this row is the last of it's parent's children.
  Path prop contains all row's parents' ids and isLastChild prop.

  These props are required to implement tree components, which renders lines connecting children with parents.

  Both Lazy and ArrayDataSources supports these new props.

* [Forms] Forms validation - better cross-fields dependencies.
  'validate' function in Metadata now receives all parent objects in path as argument.
  Each validator receives N arguments - first is the value itself, then it's container, and down to the root object.
  You can use this to make validation dependencies between items. For example:
  ```
    const value = { array: [{ id: 100, name: 'abc' }, { id: 101, name: 'bcd' }] };
    const nameValidator = (name, item, array) => [item.id > 100 && name.length < 2 && "Items with ID > 100 should have names longer than 2"];
    const meta = { array: { all: { props: { name: { validators: [nameValidator] }}}}};
  ```

* [Form]: Added server validation mechanism. If you need to get form validation state from server-side, your onSave api should return object like `{ validation?: ICanBeInvalid }`

* [Tables]: Added columns resizing and reordering possibility:
    * Added 'allowColumnsReordering' and 'allowColumnsResizing' props to the DataTable and DataTableHeaderRow.
    * Columns config was moved to the DataTable value.
    * [Breaking Change]: Removed 'settingKey' prop form DataTable, if you are using it for storing your columns in localStorage — implement it manually on your side via ```svc.uuiUserSettings``` context.

* [Tooltip] & [Dropdown]: Popper.js updated to v.2.x, added 'hide' modifier to hide body when target scrolled outside view
    * [Breaking Change]: In Popper 2 modifiers is now an array of objects, instead of an object where each property was the modifier name in the previous version. [More information.](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/migration-guide/)

* [Promo]: Added 'cell' mode for components which can be placed in table row

# 3.46.3 - 12.01.2021

**What’s New**
* [Breaking Change] UUI and edu-core-rouing packages doesn't depend on react-router and history directly anymore.
    As yarn/npm uses both your App's and UUI required versions, the version of history and react-router in your app can be changed after updating.
    This can affect your app. You can check version with ```yarn why history``` and ```yarn why react-router``` before and after update.

    This change is required to not interfere with app's versions of the router and history.
    ContextProvider still requires history object to be passed. It should have a 'IHistory4' interface - a minimal subset of the History v4 API.

    edu-core-rouing package is kept to support history and router v3 (Learn still uses them)

    Internally, we use a wrapper/proxy implementations for IRouterContext, that adapts interfaces of different history versions to our interface.
    In future, this allows us to support different routing libraries, by providing a different IRouterContext implementation.

* [Breaking Change]: Updated colors palette to matсh design specification.
   - Color names stayed the same, only hex changed;
   - New colors variables moved to @epam/loveship from @epam/assets. Old variables stayed in @epam/assets.
     So, if you use our variables in your project, and now don't ready to do this migration, just leave import from @epam/aseets in your styles.
     If you want to use new colors, please import styles from '@epam/loveship/assets/styles';
   - Pay additional attention on components where you pass color by props, for example `<Text color='night400'>`, especially for gray scale colors(probably you will not face a problems with not gray scale colors).
     Because, almost all 'night' colors changed their tone and sometimes you will need to use another color instead you have before.
     If you have questions, which color to use - please contact your project designer or use this guide:

# 3.40.0

* New **PROMO** skin components
* **DataSources rework**:
  - DataSources are now plain classes, not React components. DataSources no longer handles DataRows generation, events, and UI updates - they are just boxes with some cached / pre-computed data.
    This simplifies a lot:
      - you can create and store instances where convenient. For example, it's ok to create global instances of certain data sources, which wouldn't update often - like locations for pickers.
      - this leads to simpler APIs. For example, in Pickers instead of tricky `getDataSource = { props => <ArrayDataSource {...props } /> }` API, you just pass your DataSource: `dataSource = {{ myDataSource }} `

  - Introduced a new concept - View. Having a DataSource, component can create a View with `dataSource.getView`. Views are created per-component, allowing multiple components to share the same DataSource. They handle all component-depended logic - DataRows generation, according to search/filter/folding/selection in DataSourceState, UI updates, event handling. If you use existing components, you usually don't need to deal with Views directly, as they are created internally by components themselves. However, if you want to build your components, or just access data inside DataSources directly, they can be useful. See more in examples.

  - A set of react hooks now available: useLazyDataSource, useArrayDataSource, useAsyncDataSource, and IDataSource.useView. They create appropriate DataSources and manages subscription/unsubscription/refresh for you. While DataSources can still be used directly, please prefer hooks for Functional Components.

  - Breaking changes:

    - DataSources should be created outside the picker. With either `myDataSource = new ArrayDataSource()`, or with new useArrayDataSource() hook.

    - DataSources are passed to components with `dataSource = {{ myDataSource }} ` instead of `getDataSource = { props => <ArrayDataSource {...props } /> }`

    - some options, like getRowOptions, getSearchFields, cascadeSelection, isFoldedByDefault are moved to Views. In case of Pickers, you can pass them directly to Picker props, instead of DataSource props.

    - SortBy callback removed from columns config. By default, sorting applies by the column 'key' field.
    If you need another behavior, pass sortBy callback to the View.

    - filters removed from ArrayDataSource. Instead, you can use `getFilter` option on ArrayListView.

# 3.20.0

* 'mode' prop for most inputs. It has three values:
  * 'form' - the default one, controls appears as usual
  * 'inline' - control appears w/o borders, as plain text. Border appears on hover. Can be used for WYSIWIG-style editing.
  * 'cell' - controls appears w/o borders, hover/focus add squared border. This is intended to be used as in-cell editors in editable tables.
* Control sizes rework (backward-compatible):
  * Text and most input components, got optional lineHeight and fontSize props. Default values are chosen according to the size prop, and match prior settings. You can use these props to tweak font appearance.
    * Obviously useful for Text, but also for inline inputs; and editable cells (design guidelines put less line-height than default there)
    * The formula is: padding top/bottom = (size - line-height) / 2. This means that a control get height exactly equal to 'size' if you get one-line text, and it will be center-aligned properly.
    * Some font-sizes wouldn't fit some line-heights. Keep this in mind, and choose reasonable combinations of line-height and font-size. Design guidelines on possible combinations will be ready soon.
    * Extreme line-height and size combinations are not supported (like size=60, line-height=12). Let us know if you need that.
  * Added 42 size for most components.
  * 48 size will be deprecated, as it's not approved by design team. Let us know if you use it. The plan is to deprecate it.
* File upload facilities added:
  * A new DropSpot component, which can wrap areas where files can be dropped. It handles all machinery of file DnD events handing.
  * ApiContext.uploadFile() method added. It use XHRRequest instead of fetch, and allow tracking progress. No error handling for now, it will be added later.
  * We are still lacking docs and demos for file upload features, contact core team for help
* [Breaking changes] Removed vPadding prop from DataTable.
  * Added renderCell callback for table column props. Can be used to replace whole cell, including padding
  * Rework padding prop for DataTableCell component, now there are rowPadding(value for first and last column) and padding (value for all columns) props.

  * removed excess TS compilation pass
  * build performance improved

# 3.19.2 - broken release

* uui-build: BUILD_DIR settings

# 3.19.1

* Introduced internationalization: ability to translate component's text. Currently hard-coded texts are moved to a i18n.ts file, and can be overrided if needed. For now, only RichTextEditor-related dialogs are reworked this way. We'll refine the approach, and will allow such customization for other components when needed.
* Form components: fixes in unsaved data-related logic

# 3.19.0

* @epam/uui/Stateful Component now supports storing state in query string

* TextInput.focus() method added. Can be used via component ref.
* withMods helper now passes by wrapped component's ref with React.forwardRef
* Dropdown - fixed performance issue caused by broken events' un-subscription, and over-use of getBoundingClientRect.
* DataTableRow - enabled horizontal scrolling using middle mouse button and touchpad gestures
* Unsaved form state handling. Pass "settingsKey" prop to Form, to make form store edited values in the UserSettings context (local store by default). If Form component detect non-saved changes, it will ask user if it wants to restore these changes. Use that to provide additional barrier to not to lose user-entered data.
* The whole new icons set build by Design Platform team is pre-processed and published to @epam/assets/icons/common. Pre-processing includes file name normalization, fixing issues with symbol IDs, removing 'fill' style to be able to color icons, and other tweaks and optimizations.
  * Note: new icons are not yet compatible with UUI3 components. There are size mismatch, and we are in progress updating all buttons and input to the new size. However, we published icons early, as there can be other uses.
* Two new loaders icons in the set. Usable in any button or input.
* fixed layout problem RadioInput, Checkbox, and Dropdown menu in latest Chrome (broken SVG sizing)

# 3.18.0

* [Breaking change] DatePicker and RangeDatePicker date format handling changed:
  * value and onValueChange are now always use date in YYYY-MM-DD format, despite component's "format" prop value
  * the "format" prop now affects display format only, not internal 'value' format
  * this behaviour matches <input type='date' > behavior: it can change display format according to user's locale, but always use YYYY-MM-DD format in API. Your can swap <DatePicker> with <TextInput type='date'> on mobile devices to get better UX.
  * default value for the "format" prop is set to more readable "MMM D, YYYY", e.g. "20 May, 2019"
  * invalid dates are no longer passed to onValueChanged callback, i.e. while user types dates. onValueChange is only fired when complete and correct date is entered

# 3.7.0

* [Breaking Change] - CSS styles are extracted.
    Users need to import them explicitly.

    Before this change, we kept all CSS code inside JS, and they are injected into DOM on app start.
    However, it can hit performance, adds mess in HEAD, and it's was tricky to override UUI styles, as they get placed on top of app's styles.
    With new version, we extract all CSS into separate 'styles.css' files.
    To import styles, please add following to your index.tsx/jsx file:
    ```tsx
        import '@epam/uui-components/styles.css';
        import '@epam/loveship/styles.css';
    ```
    Consider placing these imports before any your App's import, as it would place UUI styles before yours, making it's easier to override if needed.

* [Breaking Change] Modals rendering moved from ContextProvider to the separate @epam/uui-components/Modals component. This is done to make certain contexts (like Apollo) visible inside modal components.
To update, please add make this changes:
    ```tsx
        <>
            ...
            <ErrorHandler>
                {this.props.children}
            </ErrorHandler>
            <Snackbar/>

        //...
        <Button icon={ myIcon } />
    ```
